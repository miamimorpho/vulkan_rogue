* TODO

NPCs / enemies basic basic
add fat pointer string library
message buffer -> ring buffer
changing tileset < - >
handling non8*8 tiles
maintain cursor/color state like ncurses
break out into lua at some point for gui

* Cache System

text rendering is as fast as can be now anyway
Be able to save CPU redrawing by cacheing GPU draw commands
Adds 'layers' though being able to write to a buffer then arrange
their painting order before redrawing the whole screen each frame
Ability to save common GUI elements like buttons, scroll bars, ect
reduces cpu -> gpu transactions which saves some battery life speed on mobile platforms

- cacheChange(string_id)
if string_id does not exist, adds it to the list of buffers and alloc some memory for it
uploads current scratch buffer to GPU
internally changes state of current buffer to new id;

- cachePaint(string_id);
create indirect draw command for that section of glyphs in cmdb
always upload current cache to GPU before refreshing

* Instance Attributes
| InPosition           | x, y   | uint16_t uint16_t |
/limits terminal dimensions to 65536 chars by 65536 chars
| UV Encoding          | i      | uint10_t        |
/caps each texture atlas at 1024 characters each 0 - 1023 /
| texture Index        | i      | uint6_t         |
/limits renderer to 64 different texture samplers 0 - 63 /
| color indices        | fg, bg | uint8_t uint8_t  |
/limits colour palette to 256 colours/
/spare 16 bit number/
* Enemies and Items
spot - boston dynamics dog
Gov't TV License Enforcement 
Palestine Cola
Bakeries
Tofu, Scrambled, grilled, deep fried, ect
Triffid Rum
Synth's are made of vegan meat
cultists
prefixes: cyber, pink, hellish
* vulkan style
| Functions | gfxFunctionName |
| Types     | GfxType         |
| Variables | variable_name   |
make pos x, pos y, textures_index, glyph_code, fgColor, bgColor
a coherent order

* CPU budget
60fps input/resize polling target fps - 16ms frame time
a 14ms wait on VkAcquireImageKHR gives 12.5% cpu usage:
    (1 - (14 / 16)) = 0.125

-02 no validation layers 1.5% 

* API
model API after ANSI escape codes + Ncurses
ANSI     ESC[2J      erase entire screen
curses   refresh()   Tell the curses system to dump the contents on the screen. It checks the window and updates only the portion which has been changed.
mvwaddch()	Move the cursor to a given position and then print as by addch() but into the given window.
Current implementation is addch(x, y, fg, bg, texture_index, ch);
probably better this way;

* Procederal
Static worldmap, procederal local tiles

writing driven story
william burroughs cut up tecnique

markov chains + NLP

* Art

| Machine        | Display in Tiles   | Tile Size |
| Gameboy Screen | 20*18              | 8*8       |
| MSX            | 32*24              | 8*8       |

Roguelike overworld map, use ascii chars to draw architecture
Ex

** ideas
timur novikov style landscapes for long distances, some towns
background of horizon can change for weather/time/biome
foreground is game area, could be follow cam or static cam.k
mayan glyphs in textmode appear as characters.

* Turn based
https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/07/15/a-turn-based-game-loop/

* world
entities as rooms, multi tile entities
fixed interesting world size
player can walk into the wilderness/void like fallout 4, random chance of enemies spawning near the player
Multiple Z Levels
   stairs ^
can see enemies on multiple Z levels, X@COM

* woodcutting, firestarting
trees
lighters
usable objects

* combat
not annoying, tedious
pokemon mysery dungeon

* lore
"And there arose in the digital wastes a great bird of blue and it was named X and the users looked upon it and knew not their home"
"The servers lay dead in their racks like ancient bones, their fans whispering quiet liturgies into the cold datacenter dark"
"They witnessed the NFTs fall, their worthless tokens scattered across the blockchain like the teeth of dead men in a desert"
"The moderators rode forth into that digital waste, banning and smiting with neither mercy nor remorse, and their shadow was long upon the forum"
"And the Musk did speak cryptic utterances into the void, and his words carried a market Cap across the virtual plains like plague winds"
"In the subreddit there was a great silence. No post. No comment stirred upon the front page. The downvotes lay like dark stars in that digital firmament"
"Threads rose from the Meta depths like some ancient leviathan, bearing marks and scars of platforms long dead and forgotten"
"The TikTok algorithms moved through the data like wolves through sheep, devouring attention spans with neither mercy nor satiety"
"And the cryptocurrency traders wandered those broken markets like mendicant monks, clutching their worthless coins and muttering prayers to dead chains"
"Discord lay against the digital horizon like a burning city, its servers crying out in tongues of error logs and crash reports"
