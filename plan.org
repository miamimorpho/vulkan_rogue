* TODO

move over as much to GPU as possible
instanced rendering
pre built quad in shader

https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/textureSize.xhtml textureSize();

push constant 128 bytes
32bit = 4 bytes
screen dimensions, scaling factor, tile size

in ivec2 asciiPos, could be 2*uint16
stride_x = (2 * SCALE * TILE_SIZE) / SCREEN_WIDTH;
gl_Position.x = stride_x * asciiPos.x;
gl_Position.y = stride_y * asciiPos.y;

in ivec2 atlasPos could be 2*uint16
uv_stride.x = glyph_size / texture.width
uv_stride.y = glyph_size / texture.width
outUv.x = atlasPos.x * uv_stride.x;

texture atlas index uint 8
fg color uint8
bg color uint8

select -> dump ascii;
multi tile entity;
scroll up/down;
event listeners;
conglomerate paint UI;
learn to benchmark in debugger;
aim for pcmanfm requirements: 4% CPU, 20mb RAM ~
quick ui design spec
clever ui - print letter to screen + clicking buttons
NPCs / enemies basic basic
png->bdf to redistribute some assets

* IDEAS

** API
model API after ANSI escape codes + Ncurses
ANSI     ESC[2J      erase entire screen
curses   refresh()   Tell the curses system to dump the contents on the screen. It checks the window and updates only the portion which has been changed.
mvwaddch()	Move the cursor to a given position and then print as by addch() but into the given window.
Current implementation is addch(x, y, fg, bg, texture_index, ch);
probably better this way;

** Art
timur novikov style landscapes for long distances, some towns
background of horizon can change for weather/time/biome
foreground is game area, could be follow cam or static cam.k
mayan glyphs in textmode appear as characters.

** Turn based
https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/07/15/a-turn-based-game-loop/

** world
entities as rooms, multi tile entities
fixed interesting world size
player can walk into the wilderness/void like fallout 4, random chance of enemies spawning near the player
Multiple Z Levels
   stairs ^
can see enemies on multiple Z levels, X@COM

** woodcutting, firestarting
trees
lighters
usable objects

** combat
not annoying, tedious
pokemon mysery dungeon
