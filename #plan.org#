* TODO

instanced rendering
pre built quad in shader


select -> dump ascii;
multi tile entity;
scroll up/down;
event listeners;
conglomerate paint UI;
learn to benchmark in debugger;
move vertex calculation to GPU, can send ints instead of floats
cache CPU calculations, unicode to four UV's
aim for pcmanfm requirements: 4% CPU, 20mb RAM ~
quick ui design spec
clever ui - print letter to screen + clicking buttons
NPCs / enemies basic basic
png->bdf to redistribute some assets

** world
entities as rooms, multi tile entities

** woodcutting, firestarting
trees
lighters
usable objects
